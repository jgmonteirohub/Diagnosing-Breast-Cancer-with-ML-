# Classifying Breast Masses as Benign or Malignant Based on Physical Characteristics of Cell Nuclei
* Created a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a breast mass is cancerous based on physical characteristics of cell nuclei from the breast mass
* The data was collected by the University of Wisconsin and consists of 30+ physical attriputes of cell nuclei based on images taken of the breast mass with a fine needle aspirate
* Classification machine learning algorithms were implemented in R programming, such as Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting, and more.
* After observing their performance, the Boosting model was determined to be the most effective model with an accuracy of 95.6
